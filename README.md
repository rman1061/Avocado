HI everyone! So this is just a quick lesson for reading the dataset, performing simple data analysis with the dataset that includes looking at some descriptive statistics. 
Data Visualization is also a key aspect of analysis, it is a nice way to get to know your data. I will be using Histograms to visualize the distribution of numerical data over a range of values. For datasets with multiple numerical columns, histograms are a great way to understand data distributions.
