# Avocado

HI everyone! So this is just a quick lesson for reading the dataset, performing simple data analysis with the dataset that includes looking at some descriptive statistics. 
Data Visualization is also a key aspect of analysis, it is a nice way to get to know your data. I will be using Histograms to visualize the distribution of numerical data over a range of values. For datasets with multiple numerical columns, histograms are a great way to understand data distributions. 

In this Avocado dataset, we will be comparing the number of avocados with the average price of a single avocado, Total number of avocados sold, Total number of avocados with PLU 4046 sold, Total number of avocados with PLU 4225 sold, Total number of avocados with PLU 4770 sold, Total No. Bags, No. Small Bags and No. Large Bags.
